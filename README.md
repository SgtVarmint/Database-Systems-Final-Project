This was our final project for CS309 - Database Systems

It was intended to be a small scale simulation of how ITS at Elizabethtown College keeps track of the information in different computer labs across campus.

There is a directory that holds the Business Rules that we worked with for our project.

There is also a .sql file which, believe it or not, is our sql file that loads the database.
